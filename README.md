# Final_project
The main objective is to answer the following questions:



Retention is one of the most crucial metrics.  

Write a function that calculates player retention (by days since the player's registration date).


Analyze the results from an A/B test in which two groups of users were offered different sets of promotional offers. 

Which set of offers can be considered the best? 

What metrics should be analyzed to make the right decision and how?



What metrics can be used to evaluate the results of the most recent event in the game "Plants & Gardens"?

Suppose in another event, we made the event mechanics more challenging so that with each unsuccessful attempt to complete a level, a player would regress several levels backward. Would this change the set of metrics used to evaluate the results?

If so, how?
